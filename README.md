# Purple Pixel Palate Planner 🍎

A modern, free macros tracking Progressive Web App (PWA) built with AI-powered development tools. Born out of frustration with expensive macro tracking apps that charge for basic functionality that should be free.

## 🚀 Why This Project Exists

I wasn't satisfied with existing macros tracking apps - they either lacked essential features or charged premium prices for basic macro counting functionality. Instead of settling for subpar options or paying monthly fees, I decided to build my own solution using modern AI development tools.

This project demonstrates how quickly you can create a fully-featured, professional-grade application using AI-powered development platforms like Lovable. What traditionally would take weeks or months of development was accomplished in a fraction of the time.
